######################~~~~~~~~~~ ATM Interface ~~~~~~~~~~######################

This program implements a basic ATM interface in Java, allowing users to check their account balance, 
withdraw money, and deposit funds. 
It provides a simple command-line user interface with a menu-driven system. 

The program validates user input and displays appropriate messages based on the success or failure of transactions. 
The account balance is stored in the ATM object, and withdrawals are only permitted if the account has sufficient funds. 
The program is designed to provide a starting point for building more advanced ATM systems.
