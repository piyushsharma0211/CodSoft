######################~~~~~~~~~~ Word-Counter ~~~~~~~~~~######################
The Word Counter program is a Java application that allows users to count the number of words in a given text. 
It provides two options for input: manual text entry or reading text from a file. 
The program utilizes various methods to process the input text and provide useful information about the words.

Upon execution, the program prompts the user to choose between entering the text manually or providing a file. 
If the user selects manual entry, they can directly input the text. 
If they choose to provide a file, they need to provide the file path.

The program then calculates the total word count in the given text using the countWords method. 
It splits the text into an array of words using whitespace as a delimiter and returns the length of the array as the word count.

Additionally, the program offers two additional features, namely getUniqueWords and getWordFrequency, which are currently commented out in the code. 
These features can be uncommented to display the count of unique words and the frequency of each word in the text, respectively.
